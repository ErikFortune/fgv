## Phase status

| Phase | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| A — design exploration | ✅ complete | `design.md` written and amended per Erik review (extend `IAiStreamEvent` directly; §2.X consumer-driven vs ai-assist-driven loop examples + layering); updated 2026-06-03 to swap `parametersSchema: JsonObject` → `ISchemaValidator<TParams>` (typed-schema authoring). PR #436 carries the amended design. |
| B — triage | ✅ complete | All six decisions locked (PR #446). B4 spike findings documented in `b4-spike-findings.md`. |
| C — implementation (layer 1 — harness tools) | ✅ complete | branch: `chore/ai-assist-client-tools-phase-c-impl`. C1–C4 implemented 2026-06-04. PR open. |
| Layer 2 — MCP | ⏸ deferred | Sprint+1 or later; Phase A names the seam but doesn't sub-phase it. Layer 2 uses `JsonSchema.fromJson` for MCP-discovered tools → `IAiClientTool<JsonValue>`. |

## Decisions log

| Decision | Rationale |
|---|---|
| design-triage-implement workflow shape, not direct stream | This is "what would it take" research, not "implement X" execution. Erik wants the sizing + design before committing the sprint window. |
| Two sequenced layers: harness tools first, MCP later | Harness tools are the near-term consumer requirement (personaility memory tool); MCP is longer-term and structurally additive on top of harness tools if Phase A designs the seam correctly. Sequencing keeps the first layer shippable. |
| Phase A senior-developer agent run, foreground design output | The work is architectural-design-shaped: cross-provider API survey + native-surface sketch + sub-phase sizing. senior-developer is the canonical fit. Output is `design.md`, not a code PR. |
| Phase A is design only — no code changes | Keeps the artifact reviewable in one read; Erik decides on Phase B/C before any code lands. |
| MCP as a separate `@fgv/ts-extras-mcp` Result-integration boundary package (working assumption — Phase A confirms) | Per the integration-boundary convention. Phase A design confirms: the seam is `IAiClientTool`; MCP adds a new package that converts MCP tool descriptors to `IAiClientTool[]` without touching ts-extras. |
| No agentic-orchestration framework | The consumer drives the conversation loop; ai-assist makes the tool-use round-trip safe and ergonomic. Recommendation: `executeClientToolTurn` helper returns `{events, nextTurn}` — consumer drives the outer loop. |
| Per-call client tools (not registered) | Matches existing server-tool pattern; lifecycle simplicity; MCP brings its own registration concept via discovery. |
| Typed schema authoring (`JsonSchema.object(...)`) as parameter source-of-truth — supersedes the previous `JsonObject` recommendation (2026-06-03) | `parametersSchema: ISchemaValidator<TParams>` from `@fgv/ts-json-base`. Consumer authors once with `JsonSchema.object(...)` factories; `TParams` derived via `Static<typeof schema>` — no drift between wire schema and runtime validation. `parametersSchema.toJson()` emits wire format for the provider adapter. `parametersSchema.validate(args)` validates model-returned args in the round-trip helper — verify-not-assert end-to-end from day one of Phase C. `json-schema-derives-t` shipped to release via PR #444 (2026-06-03); this swap was the reason Phase B/C were held. MCP boundary (layer 2) uses `JsonSchema.fromJson(rawSchema)` → `ISchemaValidator<JsonValue>` for tools arriving from MCP servers — same plumbing, opaque `T`. |
| Extend `IAiStreamEvent` directly with tool-use variants (override 2026-06-02) | Erik: we own all consumers and update exhaustive switches in lockstep; the cleaner shape beats backwards-compat ergonomics. `IAiStreamEventWithClientTools` dropped. |
| Seam is `IAiClientTool` (config + callback pair) | Layer 1 consumers construct directly; layer 2 (MCP) converts MCP tool descriptors to `IAiClientTool[]`. Same streaming/round-trip plumbing serves both. |
| Anthropic thinking + tools B4 flag | Material unknown: Anthropic may require thinking blocks in round-trip history. Must be verified empirically in Phase C before finalizing continuation builder. See design.md §2.7 and §4.4. |
| Phase B/C held for `json-schema-derives-t` to land (Erik 2026-06-02) — **hold lifted 2026-06-03** | Erik picked Option 1 from the phase-2 alignment-spike verdict: commission `json-schema-derives-t` now, hold ai-assist-client-tools Phase B/C until it lands. Goal: Phase C adopts typed-schema authoring from day one — verify-not-assert end-to-end; no two-step authoring migration for personaility. `json-schema-derives-t` shipped to release via PR #444 (2026-06-03). design.md updated to swap `parametersSchema: JsonObject` → `parametersSchema: ISchemaValidator<TParams>`. Hold lifted; Phase B ready to commission. |

## Origin

2026-05-30 conversation. Erik tracking personaility's roadmap into agentic territory (memory tool, harness-supplied capabilities), realized client-tool support in ai-assist is **one sprint out**. Today ai-assist supports server tools only and only `web_search` (`AiServerToolType = 'web_search'` is a single-value union; toolFormat adapters switch only on that case). Personaility's near-term work needs the harness-tools layer; MCP is the natural longer-term extension.

Phase A commissioned as research+design now so the sizing exists before Erik commits the sprint window.

## History

| Date | Event | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| 2026-06-04 | Phase C C1–C4 implemented | C1: model types + `IAiClientTool`, `IAiClientToolConfig`, `IAiClientToolContinuation`, `IAiStreamToolEvent` variants. C2: Anthropic adapter updated — tool-use streaming, client tool dispatching, continuation builder. C3: `executeClientToolTurn` harness — returns `{ events: AsyncIterable<IAiStreamEvent>, nextTurn: Promise<Result<IAiClientToolTurnResult>> }`. C4: packlet re-exports, B-6 testbed scenario (Anthropic + thinking + memory client tool + web_search server tool), `continuationMessages` parameter added to `IExecuteClientToolTurnParams` (design gap fixed: continuation wire messages are `ReadonlyArray<JsonObject>` not `IChatMessage[]`), `rawTail` added to `IBuildMessagesOptions` in `chatRequestBuilders.ts`, `LIBRARY_CAPABILITIES.md` extended, state.md updated. All gates green (build/lint/test/coverage). |
| 2026-05-30 | FUTURE.md entry added; substrate prepped | brief.md + state.md + design-doc target named. |
| 2026-05-30 | Phase A senior-developer agent commissioned | Design doc target: `.ai/tasks/active/ai-assist-client-tools/design.md`. |
| 2026-06-02 | Phase A design complete | design.md written. Covers §§1–5: cross-provider survey, fgv-native surface sketch, harness/MCP split, Phase C sizing, recommendation. Key open item: Anthropic thinking + tools round-trip empirical verification (B4). |
| 2026-06-02 | Phase A design amended per Erik review | Dropped `IAiStreamEventWithClientTools` union (extending `IAiStreamEvent` directly); added §2.X consumer-driven vs ai-assist-driven loop examples with layering confirmation. JSON-Schema-Converter alignment spike commissioned separately. |
| 2026-06-02 | Phase B/C placed on HOLD pending `json-schema-derives-t` | Erik picked Option 1 from the phase-2 alignment spike verdict: commission `json-schema-derives-t` now, hold ai-assist-client-tools Phase B/C until it lands. Phase C will adopt typed-schema authoring for `IAiClientToolConfig.parametersSchema` from day one (verify-not-assert end-to-end). When `json-schema-derives-t` merges to `release`, Phase B commissions against an updated design.md that swaps `parametersSchema: JsonObject` for typed `ILlmSchema<TParams>` authoring. |
| 2026-06-03 | Phase A design updated for typed-schema authoring. Hold lifted; Phase B ready to commission. | `json-schema-derives-t` shipped to release via PR #444. The `IAiClientToolConfig.parametersSchema: JsonObject` recommendation swapped to `ISchemaValidator<TParams>` (with `TParams` derived via `Static<typeof schema>` from `@fgv/ts-json-base`). Verify-not-assert end-to-end from day one of Phase C. Consumer code per tool shorter — no hand-rolled Converter duplicating the schema; execute callback receives typed args directly. Phase C sub-phase sizing updated (~14–15 files vs prior ~16). MCP layer 2 path: `JsonSchema.fromJson(rawSchema)` → `ISchemaValidator<JsonValue>` → `IAiClientTool<JsonValue>` — same plumbing, opaque T. |
