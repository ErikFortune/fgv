# Sudoku Application UX Design - Revised

## Executive Summary

This document defines the user experience design for the sudoku application, revised based on practical user feedback and experience with existing sudoku apps. The design prioritizes preventing user errors, reducing cognitive load, and providing efficient input methods across desktop and mobile platforms.

## Key Design Principles

### 1. Error Prevention Over Error Correction
- Default to safer input modes that prevent accidental value entries
- Provide clear visual feedback for different input states
- Design interfaces that make user intent explicit

### 2. Platform-Optimized Input Methods
- **Desktop**: Keyboard-first interaction with modifier keys for precision
- **Mobile**: Touch-optimized dual keypad system with clear mode separation
- **Universal**: Consistent logic across platforms with platform-appropriate implementations

### 3. Smart Multi-Selection Logic
- Intelligent toggle behavior that adapts to current cell states
- Clear visual feedback for selection states
- Minimal cognitive load for understanding selection behavior

### 4. Playtest-Driven Development
- Start with core functionality and test with real users
- Iterate based on actual usage patterns, not theoretical design
- Defer complex features until core experience is validated

## Input Method Design

### Desktop Platform

#### Primary Input Philosophy
- **Default Mode**: Notes entry (prevents accidental value commits)
- **Value Entry**: Requires explicit user intent via modifier keys
- **Rationale**: Experienced sudoku players make more notes than value entries, and accidental value entries are harder to recover from

#### Keyboard Interaction Patterns
```
Standard Number Press (1-9):
├── Default Behavior: Add/remove note in selected cells
├── Ctrl+Number (simultaneous): Commit value to selected cells
└── Long Press (>500ms): Commit value to selected cells

Additional Controls:
├── Escape: Clear selection
├── Delete/Backspace: Clear notes and values from selected cells
├── Space: Toggle between notes/values mode (alternative input)
└── Tab/Shift+Tab: Navigate cells for keyboard-only users
```

#### Visual Input Mode Indicators
```
Mode Indicator Location: Bottom-right of interface
├── Notes Mode: "📝 Notes" (active by default)
├── Values Mode: "✏️ Values" (when explicitly activated)
└── Modifier Active: "⌘ Values" (when Ctrl held)
```

### Mobile Platform

#### Dual Keypad System
- **Side-by-side layout** in portrait mode for easy thumb access
- **Clear visual separation** between Notes and Values keypads
- **Consistent positioning** to build muscle memory

#### Portrait Layout (Primary Mobile Experience)
```
Sudoku Grid (top 70% of screen)
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│                             │
│        9x9 Grid             │
│                             │
└─────────────────────────────┘

Input Keypads (bottom 30% of screen)
┌──────────────┬──────────────┐
│    NOTES     │    VALUES    │
│ [1][2][3]    │ [1][2][3]    │
│ [4][5][6]    │ [4][5][6]    │
│ [7][8][9]    │ [7][8][9]    │
│ [ Clear ]    │ [ Clear ]    │
└──────────────┴──────────────┘
```

#### Landscape Layout (Tablet/Large Phone)
```
┌─────────────────┬─────────────┐
│                 │   NOTES     │
│    9x9 Grid     │ [1][2][3]   │
│                 │ [4][5][6]   │
│                 │ [7][8][9]   │
│                 │ [ Clear ]   │
│                 ├─────────────┤
│                 │   VALUES    │
│                 │ [1][2][3]   │
│                 │ [4][5][6]   │
│                 │ [7][8][9]   │
│                 │ [ Clear ]   │
└─────────────────┴─────────────┘
```

#### Touch Target Requirements
- **Minimum size**: 44px × 44px (iOS HIG standard)
- **Optimal size**: 60px × 60px for number buttons
- **Spacing**: 8px minimum between touch targets
- **Responsive scaling**: Adapt to screen size while maintaining minimums

### Cross-Platform Consistency

#### Shared Interaction Logic
- Same multi-select behavior across platforms
- Consistent visual feedback for cell states
- Unified undo/redo system that works with both input methods
- Common settings that affect both platforms

#### Platform-Specific Optimizations
- **Desktop**: Hover states, right-click context menus, keyboard shortcuts
- **Mobile**: Touch gestures, haptic feedback, swipe-to-clear actions
- **Both**: Focus management for accessibility compliance

## Multi-Select Cell Logic

### Selection Mechanics

#### Basic Selection
```
Single Cell Selection:
├── Click/Tap: Select single cell, clear previous selection
├── Ctrl+Click (desktop): Toggle individual cell in/out of selection
└── Shift+Click (desktop): Extend selection from last selected cell

Touch Selection (Mobile):
├── Tap: Select single cell
├── Long press: Start multi-select mode
└── Subsequent taps: Toggle cells in/out of selection while in multi-select mode
```

#### Smart Toggle Behavior
The system analyzes the current state of all selected cells and applies intelligent toggle logic:

```
Notes Toggle Logic:
├── If ALL selected cells have note N: Remove note N from all cells
├── If SOME selected cells have note N: Add note N to all cells (normalize to "all have")
├── If NO selected cells have note N: Add note N to all cells
└── Priority: Normalize toward "all cells have the same state"

Values Entry Logic:
├── If multiple cells selected: Only allow entry in empty cells
├── If cell has value: Require explicit clear action before new value
├── Auto-clear conflicting notes when value is entered
└── Highlight conflicts immediately but don't block entry (user setting)
```

### Visual Selection Feedback

#### Selection States
```
Cell Visual States:
├── Unselected: Default cell appearance
├── Single Selected: Blue border (2px, #007AFF)
├── Multi-Selected: Blue background (rgba(0, 122, 255, 0.15))
├── Last Selected: Combination of border + background
└── Conflict Warning: Red border overlay (when relevant)
```

#### Avoiding Complex Borders
- **Rationale**: Killer sudoku cages already use borders for cage definition
- **Solution**: Use background colors and subtle shadows instead of thick borders
- **Accessibility**: Maintain 3:1 contrast ratio for selection indicators

### Multi-Select Visual Design

#### Selection Indicators
```
Multi-Select State Indicators:
├── Selection Count: "3 cells selected" (top toolbar)
├── Action Preview: "Add note 5 to 3 cells" (contextual hint)
├── Clear Selection: ✕ button in toolbar when multi-select active
└── Selection Mode: Persistent until explicitly cleared
```

## Game Settings and Behavior

### Error Handling Settings

#### Conflict Detection Options
```
Setting: "Error Highlighting"
├── Option 1: "No Highlighting" - Never show conflicts
├── Option 2: "Show Conflicts" - Highlight conflicting values in red
└── Default: "Show Conflicts" (helps learning)

Implementation:
├── Visual: Red text color or background for conflicting values
├── Scope: Check row, column, 3x3 section constraints
├── Live Updates: Check on every value entry
└── No Blocking: Users can always enter values regardless of conflicts
```

#### Auto-Clear Notes Setting
```
Setting: "Auto-clear Notes"
├── Option 1: "Off" - Never automatically clear notes
├── Option 2: "On" - Clear impossible notes when values entered
└── Default: "On" (matches most sudoku apps)

Behavior:
├── Trigger: When a value is entered in any cell
├── Scope: Clear notes of that value from same row/column/section
├── Undo Integration: Restore auto-cleared notes when undoing value entry
└── Visual Feedback: Brief animation showing which notes were cleared
```

### Undo System Requirements

#### Undo Stack Design
```
Undo Actions Tracked:
├── Value Entry: Cell location, old value, new value
├── Note Changes: Cell location, old notes array, new notes array
├── Auto-Clear Notes: All affected cells and their previous notes
├── Multi-Cell Operations: Bundle related changes into single undo action
└── Clear Operations: Track all affected cells as group

Undo Behavior:
├── Granularity: One user action = one undo step
├── Auto-Clear Restoration: Undo value entry restores auto-cleared notes
├── Multi-Select Operations: Undo affects all cells that were changed
└── Visual Feedback: Brief highlight of cells affected by undo
```

#### Undo UI Elements
```
Undo Controls:
├── Desktop: Ctrl+Z keyboard shortcut + toolbar button
├── Mobile: Swipe gesture (swipe left on keypad area) + toolbar button
├── Button State: Disabled when no actions to undo
└── Redo: Ctrl+Y (desktop) / toolbar button (both platforms)
```

## Killer Sudoku Approach

### Phase 1: Basic Implementation
Focus on core killer sudoku functionality without advanced features:

```
Phase 1 Features:
├── Cage Visual Display: Clear cage borders with totals
├── Cage Constraint Validation: Values in cage must sum to total
├── Basic Input: Same note/value system works within cages
├── Conflict Detection: Include cage sum validation in error checking
└── Simple Cage Selection: Clicking cage total selects all cage cells
```

### Phase 2: Enhanced Features (Future)
Defer these until core experience is validated:

```
Deferred Features:
├── Killer Combinations Helper: Show possible number combinations
├── Auto-Cage Selection: Smart selection of related cage cells
├── Running Totals: Real-time display of current cage sums
├── Cage-Specific Hints: Suggest values based on cage math
└── Advanced Cage Types: Support for non-standard killer variants
```

### Cage Visual Design

#### Cage Border Styling
```
Cage Visual Treatment:
├── Border: 2px dashed line in cage color
├── Corner Radius: 4px for visual softness
├── Total Display: Small text in top-left corner of cage
├── Color Coding: Different colors for different cages (accessibility-safe palette)
└── Overlap Handling: Use different dash patterns when cages overlap
```

#### Cage Total Display
```
Total Label Design:
├── Position: Top-left corner of cage (outside grid if possible)
├── Typography: 12px bold, high contrast color
├── Background: Semi-transparent white/black for readability
├── Interactive: Clicking total selects all cage cells
└── Validation State: Color changes if current sum is invalid
```
