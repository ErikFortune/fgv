**Date**: September 28, 2024
**Phase**: Requirements Analysis (COMPLETED)
**Agent**: TPM Agent

## Executive Summary

Implementation of advanced UI components for Killer Sudoku puzzle games, building upon the existing `@fgv/ts-sudoku-lib` foundation to create interactive, visually appealing puzzle interfaces with cage visualization and constraint validation.

## Core Requirements

### 1. Killer Sudoku Game Component
- **Primary Component**: Interactive game board supporting killer sudoku rules
- **Cage Visualization**: Visual representation of number groups (cages) with sum constraints
- **Cell Interaction**: Number input with real-time validation
- **Constraint Display**: Clear indication of cage sum requirements
- **Error Feedback**: Visual feedback for constraint violations

### 2. Puzzle Visualization
- **Cage Boundaries**: Distinct visual borders around grouped cells
- **Sum Labels**: Clear display of target sums for each cage
- **Cell States**: Visual distinction between empty, filled, valid, and invalid cells
- **Interactive Feedback**: Hover states and selection indicators

### 3. User Interaction
- **Number Input**: Keyboard and/or UI-based number entry
- **Cell Selection**: Click/tap to select cells for input
- **Validation**: Real-time checking of killer sudoku constraints
- **Undo/Redo**: Action history for puzzle solving

### 4. Integration Requirements
- **Library Integration**: Seamless use of `@fgv/ts-sudoku-lib` puzzle engine
- **Result Pattern**: Consistent error handling using `@fgv/ts-utils` Result pattern
- **TypeScript**: Full type safety and proper interfaces
- **Testing**: 100% test coverage following monorepo standards

## Technical Specifications

### Architecture
- **Component-based**: Modular React/UI component structure
- **State Management**: Efficient puzzle state handling
- **Event System**: Proper event handling for user interactions

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Core Component Architecture
- Define component interfaces and props
- Set up basic killer sudoku game component structure
- Integrate with `@fgv/ts-sudoku-lib`

### Phase 2: Cage Visualization
- Implement cage boundary rendering
- Add sum label positioning and display
- Create visual styling for cage groups

### Phase 3: User Interaction
- Add number input handling
- Implement cell selection logic
- Create validation feedback system

### Phase 4: Polish & Testing
- Add undo/redo functionality
- Implement accessibility features
- Achieve 100% test coverage
- Performance optimization

## Risk Assessment

### High Priority Risks
- **Complex Cage Visualization**: Rendering overlapping or complex cage shapes
- **Performance**: Large puzzles with many cages may impact rendering speed
- **User Experience**: Balancing information density with usability

### Mitigation Strategies
- Start with simple rectangular cages and extend to complex shapes
- Implement efficient rendering with virtualization if needed
- Iterative user testing and feedback incorporation

## Dependencies

### Internal Dependencies
- `@fgv/ts-sudoku-lib` - Puzzle logic and constraint validation
- `@fgv/ts-utils` - Result pattern and utilities
- `@fgv/ts-utils-jest` - Testing framework extensions

### External Dependencies
- React (assumed UI framework)
- CSS-in-JS solution for styling
- Testing libraries (Jest, React Testing Library)

## Success Metrics

- **Functional**: All exit criteria validated
- **Quality**: 100% test coverage, zero lint errors
- **User Experience**: Positive user feedback on usability
- **Performance**: Smooth interaction with 9x9 killer sudoku puzzles
- **Integration**: Seamless use of monorepo libraries

This requirements analysis provides the foundation for implementing a comprehensive Killer Sudoku UI solution that meets both technical standards and user experience expectations.
