# Killer Sudoku Codebase Analysis

## Architecture Overview

The ts-sudoku-lib follows a packlet-based architecture with clear separation of concerns:

### Key Packlets
- **common/**: Core types, interfaces, and data structures
- **puzzles/**: Puzzle implementations including KillerSudokuPuzzle
- **hints/**: Hint system and puzzle solving assistance
- **collections/**: Data management and collections
- **file/**: File I/O operations

### Existing Killer Sudoku Infrastructure

#### Core Classes and Types
1. **KillerSudokuPuzzle** (`puzzles/killerSudokuPuzzle.ts`)
   - Extends base Puzzle class
   - Handles killer-specific cage creation and validation
   - Uses Result pattern for error handling

2. **Cage** (`common/cage.ts`)
   - Represents a killer sudoku cage
   - Properties: `id`, `cageType`, `total`, `cellIds`
   - Methods: `containsCell()`, `containsValue()`, `containedValues()`

3. **Core Types** (`common/common.ts`)
   - `CageId`, `CellId` - branded string types for type safety
   - `CageType` - includes 'killer' type
   - `totalsByCageSize` - min/max totals by cage size (already exists!)

#### Existing Utilities
- `totalsByCageSize`: Array providing min/max possible totals for cage sizes 1-9
- Comprehensive type system with branded types
- Result pattern usage throughout
- 100% test coverage requirement

### Architecture Patterns Observed

1. **Result Pattern**: Consistent use of `Result<T>` for all fallible operations
2. **Branded Types**: Type-safe identifiers (`CageId`, `CellId`)
3. **Factory Pattern**: Static `create()` methods with validation
4. **Immutability**: Readonly properties and defensive copying
5. **Packlet Organization**: Clear modular structure

### Integration Points

1. **Puzzle/PuzzleState**: Main game state management
2. **Cage System**: Existing cage infrastructure to build upon
3. **Hints System**: Potential integration point for solver assistance
4. **Type System**: Must align with existing branded types

### Key Findings

1. **totalsByCageSize already exists** - provides min/max totals per cage size
2. **Cage class** has helper methods (`containsValue`, `containedValues`) that show the expected interaction patterns
3. **Strong typing** with branded types ensures type safety
4. **Result pattern** is mandatory for all fallible operations
5. **Test coverage** must be 100% with proper Result matchers

### Recommended Location

Based on the packlet structure, the KillerCombinations helper should be placed in:
- **Primary**: `src/packlets/common/` (utility functions used by multiple components)
- **Alternative**: `src/packlets/puzzles/` (killer-specific functionality)

The common packlet seems most appropriate as these are utility functions that could be used by hints, UI, and puzzle validation systems.
