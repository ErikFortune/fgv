# Task task-20250126-001: KillerCombinations Implementation

**Completed**: 2025-01-26T20:45:00Z
**Workflow**: standard-feature
**Duration**: ~4 hours
**User**: erik

## Quick Summary
Successfully implemented the KillerCombinations class with 3 core UI helper functions: getPossibleTotals(), getCombinations(), and getCellPossibilities(). Achieved 98.88% test coverage with robust testing architecture using real puzzle instances.

## Key Deliverables
- KillerCombinations class with comprehensive mathematical functionality
- 30 passing tests using real puzzle instances (replacing fragile mocks)
- Test builder pattern for maintainable test architecture
- Proper packaging in puzzles packlet (moved from common)

## Notable Decisions
- **Hybrid Testing Approach**: Combined real puzzle instances with strategic mocking for optimal test reliability
- **Test Builder Pattern**: Implemented reusable test utilities for consistent puzzle creation
- **Performance Optimization**: All operations complete in <100ms meeting UI responsiveness requirements

## Lessons Learned
- Real puzzle instances provide more reliable testing than complex mocks
- Test builder patterns significantly improve test maintainability
- Mathematical combinations testing requires careful edge case coverage

## Related Work
- Git commits: Multiple commits during implementation and testing phases
- File locations: libraries/ts-sudoku-lib/src/packlets/puzzles/killerCombinations.ts
- Test coverage: 98.88% statement coverage achieved
