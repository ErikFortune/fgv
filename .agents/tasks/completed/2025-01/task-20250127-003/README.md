# Task task-20250127-003: Sudoku X Implementation

**Completed**: 2025-01-27T23:45:00Z
**Workflow**: standard-feature
**Duration**: ~4 hours
**User**: Development Team

## Quick Summary
Successfully implemented complete Sudoku X support across core library, UI library, and application with diagonal constraints, visual indicators, and comprehensive testing.

## Key Deliverables
- Full Sudoku X puzzle support from core library through UI to application
- Diagonal constraint visualization with subtle gray lines
- Factory pattern integration for type-based puzzle creation
- 100% test coverage with 61+ test cases
- Zero compilation errors or lint warnings

## Notable Decisions
- **Visual Design**: Chose subtle gray diagonal lines over bold indicators for better UX
- **Architecture**: Leveraged existing cage system for diagonal constraints (elegant reuse)
- **Factory Integration**: Replaced hardcoded puzzle creation with dynamic factory pattern
- **Testing Strategy**: Achieved 100% coverage through comprehensive test planning

## Lessons Learned
- Incremental layer-by-layer development (core → UI → app) prevented integration issues
- Real-time user collaboration during implementation improved final result significantly
- Existing architectural patterns (factory, cage system) enabled rapid implementation
- Comprehensive testing caught edge cases and enabled confident refactoring
