# Task task-20250127-003-killer: Killer Sudoku Cage Visualization Implementation

**Completed**: 2025-01-28T20:00:00Z
**Workflow**: standard-feature
**Duration**: ~6 hours including visual refinements
**User**: erik

## Quick Summary
Successfully implemented comprehensive Killer Sudoku cage visualization with connected borders, sum indicators, and optimized visual hierarchy. Features sophisticated border rendering algorithm with 82% pattern optimization and seamless integration with existing Sudoku components.

## Key Deliverables
- Connected cage border rendering with two-stage optimization (256â†’47 patterns)
- CageOverlay component with SVG-based border visualization
- CageSumIndicator for cage sum display following Killer Sudoku conventions
- CageLookupManager and CagePatternManager for efficient border generation
- Balanced visual hierarchy maintaining familiar Sudoku grid appearance
- Full integration with SudokuGrid and conditional puzzle type rendering
- Sample Killer Sudoku puzzle data with working cage visualization
- Outward-facing corner algorithm for proper cage border connections

## Notable Decisions
- **Connected Border Algorithm**: Two-stage lookup optimization reducing 256 neighbor patterns to 47 unique SVG segments
- **Visual Design**: Dashed blue cage borders (6-4 pattern) for clear identification without overwhelming grid
- **Corner Implementation**: Outward-facing right-angle corners ensuring proper visual connection between adjacent cells
- **Performance Optimization**: Efficient caching and lookup tables for real-time border rendering

## Lessons Learned
- Sophisticated border algorithms require careful optimization for performance at scale
- Visual hierarchy balance is crucial for maintaining familiar Sudoku interface while adding new functionality
- Two-stage pattern optimization provides significant computational benefits (82% reduction)
- User validation throughout development ensures high-quality visual outcome

## Related Work
- Built upon existing SudokuGrid and SudokuCell infrastructure
- Leverages established puzzle type detection system
- Integrates with sample puzzle data system for immediate functionality
- Maintains compatibility with all existing Sudoku functionality
