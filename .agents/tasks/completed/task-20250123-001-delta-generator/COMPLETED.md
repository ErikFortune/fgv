# Task Completed: DeltaGenerator Feature Implementation

**Task ID**: task-20250123-001-delta-generator
**Completion Date**: 2024-09-24
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED

## Summary
Successfully implemented the DeltaGenerator class in the ts-res library to compute deltas between baseline and target resource resolvers, enabling incremental resource updates and change tracking.

## Deliverables
- ✅ DeltaGenerator class fully implemented in resources packlet
- ✅ Comprehensive test suite with 47 passing tests
- ✅ Support for new resources, updated resources, and placeholders for deletions
- ✅ Three-way diff integration for minimal delta generation
- ✅ ILogReporter integration for status/error reporting
- ✅ Idempotency verification tests

## Key Features Implemented
- Resource enumeration from both baseline and delta resolvers
- Three-way diff computation using Diff.jsonThreeWayDiff
- Partial/augment candidates for updates
- Full/replace candidates for new resources
- Placeholder tests for future delete merge type
- Context extraction from resolvers
- Skip unchanged resources optimization
- Comprehensive error handling and aggregation

## Files Created/Modified
- `/Users/erik/Development/cursor/fgv/libraries/ts-res/src/packlets/resources/deltaGenerator.ts` - Complete implementation
- `/Users/erik/Development/cursor/fgv/libraries/ts-res/src/packlets/resources/index.ts` - Added export
- `/Users/erik/Development/cursor/fgv/libraries/ts-res/src/test/unit/packlets/resources/deltaGenerator.test.ts` - Full test suite

## Critical Bug Fix
Fixed resource enumeration bug where delta-only resources were being missed. Solution implemented `_discoverAllResourceIds()` method to create union of resources from both baseline and delta resolvers.

## Test Coverage
- 47 comprehensive tests covering all scenarios
- Test-driven development approach for bug fixes
- Idempotency tests verifying correct behavior
- Placeholder tests for future delete functionality
- 100% code coverage maintained

## Architecture Highlights
- Follows Result pattern throughout
- Uses MessageAggregator for error collection
- Integrates with existing ResourceManagerBuilder
- Minimal delta storage using augment merge method
- Full value storage only for new resources

## Notes
- Delete merge type not yet implemented (placeholder tests added)
- Successfully handles resource enumeration from multiple resolvers
- Properly computes minimal deltas using three-way diff
- Ready for integration with CLI tools
