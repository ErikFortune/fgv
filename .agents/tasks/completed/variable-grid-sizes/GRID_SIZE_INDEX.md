# Variable Grid Size Implementation - Documentation Index

## Overview

This directory contains comprehensive analysis of the ts-sudoku-lib codebase to enable variable grid size support (supporting 4x4, 6x6, 8x8, 10x10, 12x12, and other sizes beyond the standard 9x9).

The analysis identifies all hardcoded 9x9 assumptions, their exact locations, and provides step-by-step implementation guidance.

## Key Insights

### Architecture Quality
- **Excellent**: The core framework is well-designed for variable grid sizes
- **IPuzzleDimensions interface** properly abstracts grid dimensions
- **Dynamic calculations** used throughout instead of hardcoded values
- **Alphanumeric encoding** supports up to 25+ values (1-9, A-Z, a-z)

### Problem Concentration
All issues are in **6 specific files** - relatively localized:
- 4 issues are in puzzle-related classes
- 1 issue is in the utilities (common.ts)
- 1 issue is in hint providers (nakedSingles)
- 1 issue is in collection loading

### Risk Level
- **Low Risk**: All changes are backward compatible with 9x9 grids
- **Well-Tested**: Core functionality has comprehensive test coverage
- **Clear Fixes**: Each problem has a specific, well-defined solution

## What Gets Unblocked

After implementing these fixes, the following becomes possible:

### Immediately After Phase 1 (40 min)
- Create and solve SudokuX puzzles in any square size
- Create killer sudoku puzzles up to 12x12
- Support any grid size up to 25x25 mathematically

### After Phase 2 (45 min more)
- Generate hints for all supported grid sizes
- Get dimension-aware explanations for hints
- Full support for all puzzle types with all grid sizes

### After Phase 3 (Optional enhancement)
- Load variable-sized puzzles from files
- Better configuration detection

## Success Criteria

When implementation is complete, these should all be true:

- [ ] All existing 9x9 tests pass (backward compatibility)
- [ ] Can create 4x4, 6x6, 12x12 SudokuX puzzles
- [ ] Can create 4x4, 6x6, 9x9, 12x12 killer sudoku puzzles
- [ ] Hints generate correctly for all sizes
- [ ] No hardcoded 9x9 assumptions remain in core code
- [ ] New tests added for variable sizes
- [ ] All three document recommendations are implemented

## Architecture Decisions Made

This analysis recommends:

1. **For KillerCombinations**: Use array bounds checking instead of hardcoded limits
2. **For NakedSingles**: Pass Puzzle context to methods for dimension access
3. **For PuzzleCollection**: Eventually add metadata to puzzle file format
4. **For All**: Maintain dimension parameters in all interfaces

These decisions preserve the excellent existing architecture while removing hardcoded assumptions.
