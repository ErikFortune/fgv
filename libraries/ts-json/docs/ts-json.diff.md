[jsonDiff(obj1, obj2, options)](./ts-json.diff.jsondiff.md)


</td><td>

Performs a deep diff comparison between two JSON values.

This function provides detailed change tracking by analyzing every difference between two JSON structures. It returns a list of specific changes with paths, making it ideal for debugging, logging, change analysis, and understanding exactly what has changed between two data states.

\*\*Key Features:\*\* - Deep recursive comparison of nested objects and arrays - Precise path tracking using dot notation (e.g., "user.profile.name") - Support for all JSON value types: objects, arrays, primitives, null - Configurable array comparison (ordered vs unordered) - Optional inclusion of unchanged values for complete comparisons

\*\*Use Cases:\*\* - Debugging data changes in applications - Generating change logs or audit trails - Validating API responses against expected data - Creating detailed diff reports for data synchronization

[jsonEquals(obj1, obj2)](./ts-json.diff.jsonequals.md)


</td><td>

A simpler helper function that returns true if two JSON values are deeply equal.

This function provides a fast boolean check for JSON equality without the overhead of tracking individual changes. It performs the same deep comparison logic as [Diff.jsonDiff()](./ts-json.diff.jsondiff.md) but returns only a true/false result, making it ideal for conditional logic and validation scenarios.

\*\*Key Features:\*\* - Deep recursive comparison of all nested structures - Handles all JSON types: objects, arrays, primitives, null - Object property order independence - Array order significance (index positions matter) - Performance optimized for equality checking

\*\*Use Cases:\*\* - Conditional logic based on data equality - Input validation and testing assertions - Caching and memoization keys - Quick checks before expensive diff operations

<tr><td>

[jsonThreeWayDiff(obj1, obj2)](./ts-json.diff.jsonthreewaydiff.md)


</td><td>

Performs a three-way diff comparison between two JSON values, returning separate objects containing the differences and similarities.

This function provides an alternative to [Diff.jsonDiff()](./ts-json.diff.jsondiff.md) that focuses on actionable results rather than detailed change analysis. Instead of a list of individual changes, it returns three objects that can be directly used for merging, UI display, or programmatic manipulation.

\*\*Key Features:\*\* - \*\*Actionable Results\*\*: Returns objects ready for immediate use in merging operations - \*\*Simplified Array Handling\*\*: Arrays are treated as atomic values for cleaner results - \*\*Structural Preservation\*\*: Maintains original JSON structure rather than flattened paths - \*\*UI-Optimized\*\*: Perfect for side-by-side diff displays and change visualization - \*\*Merge-Friendly\*\*: Designed specifically for three-way merge scenarios

\*\*Array Handling:\*\* Unlike [Diff.jsonDiff()](./ts-json.diff.jsondiff.md)<!-- -->, this function treats arrays as complete units. If arrays differ, the entire array appears in the appropriate result object rather than computing element-by-element deltas. This approach is simpler and more predictable for most use cases involving data updates and synchronization.

\*\*Use Cases:\*\* - Applying configuration updates while preserving unchanged settings - Creating side-by-side diff displays in user interfaces - Building three-way merge tools for data synchronization - Implementing undo/redo functionality with granular control - Generating patch objects for API updates

</th></tr></thead>
<tbody><tr><td>

[IDiffChange](./ts-json.diff.idiffchange.md)


</td><td>

Represents a single change in a JSON diff operation.

Each change describes a specific difference between two JSON values, including the location of the change and the old/new values involved.


</td></tr>
<tr><td>

[IDiffResult](./ts-json.diff.idiffresult.md)


</td><td>

Result of a JSON diff operation containing all detected changes.

This interface provides detailed information about every difference found between two JSON values, making it ideal for analysis, debugging, and understanding exactly what changed.


</td></tr>
<tr><td>

[IJsonDiffOptions](./ts-json.diff.ijsondiffoptions.md)


</td><td>

Options for customizing JSON diff behavior.

These options allow you to control how the diff algorithm processes different types of JSON structures and what information is included in the results.


</td></tr>
<tr><td>

[IThreeWayDiff](./ts-json.diff.ithreewaydiff.md)


</td><td>

Result of a three-way JSON diff operation.

This interface provides an actionable representation of differences between two JSON values by separating them into three distinct objects. This approach makes it easy to apply changes, display side-by-side comparisons, perform merges, or programmatically work with the differences.

\*\*Key Benefits:\*\* - \*\*Actionable Results\*\*: Objects can be directly used for merging or applying changes - \*\*UI-Friendly\*\*: Perfect for side-by-side diff displays with clear visual separation - \*\*Merge-Ready\*\*: Simplified three-way merge operations - \*\*Structured Data\*\*: Maintains original JSON structure rather than flattened paths


</td></tr>
<tr><td>

[IThreeWayDiffMetadata](./ts-json.diff.ithreewaydiffmetadata.md)


</td><td>

Metadata about the differences found in a three-way diff.

Provides summary statistics about the types and quantities of changes detected between two JSON values, making it easy to understand the overall scope of differences at a glance.
