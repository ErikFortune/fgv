## Diff.IThreeWayDiffMetadata interface

Metadata about the differences found in a three-way diff.

Provides summary statistics about the types and quantities of changes detected between two JSON values, making it easy to understand the overall scope of differences at a glance.

**Signature:**

```typescript
export interface IThreeWayDiffMetadata 
```

## Example


```typescript
const metadata: IThreeWayDiffMetadata = {
  removed: 2,    // 2 properties only in first object
  added: 1,      // 1 property only in second object
  modified: 3,   // 3 properties changed between objects
  unchanged: 5   // 5 properties identical in both objects
};

console.log(`Total changes: ${metadata.added + metadata.removed + metadata.modified}`);
console.log(`Stability: ${metadata.unchanged / (metadata.unchanged + metadata.modified) * 100}%`);
```
