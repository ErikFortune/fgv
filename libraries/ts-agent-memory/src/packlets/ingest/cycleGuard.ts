 * @remarks
 * Distinct from the read-time BFS in `LinkTraversalRetriever` (which tolerates
 * cycles via a visited-set): this is a WRITE-time admission check. Cycle
 * detection is DFS reachability — a proposed `source -> target` edge closes a
 * cycle iff `target` already reaches `source` in the graph built so far. Proposed
 * edges are folded in one at a time (in order), so an intra-batch cycle
 * (`A->B`, `B->A` both proposed) is caught as well as a batch-vs-existing cycle.
 *
 * See the design note §4: this enforces GLOBAL directed-acyclicity over all link
 * types (conservative — a mutual associative pair is rejected). Callers that need
 * mutual links disable the guard.
