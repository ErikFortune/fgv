## QualifierConditionValue type

Branded type for a validated qualifier condition value - i.e. a value that has been determined to be valid for use in a condition attached to some resource.

**Signature:**

```typescript
export type QualifierConditionValue = Brand<string, 'QualifierConditionValue'>;
```

## Example

For a language qualifier type, it is likely that a single language tag can be used for either a condition or a context value. However, a list of languages would likely only be valid as a context value.
