## ResourceManagerBuilder.getBuiltResourceTree() method

Builds and returns a hierarchical tree representation of all resources managed by this builder. Resources are organized based on their dot-separated resource IDs (e.g., "app.messages.welcome" becomes a tree with "app" as root, "messages" as branch, and "welcome" as leaf).

String-based validation is available through the `children.validating` property, allowing callers to use `tree.children.validating.getById(stringId)` for validated access.

Uses lazy initialization with caching for performance.

**Signature:**

```typescript
getBuiltResourceTree(): Result<ResourceTree.IReadOnlyResourceTreeRoot<Resource>>;
```
**Returns:**

Result&lt;[ResourceTree.IReadOnlyResourceTreeRoot](./ts-res.runtime.resourcetree.ireadonlyresourcetreeroot.md)<!-- -->&lt;[Resource](./ts-res.resource.md)<!-- -->&gt;&gt;

Result containing the resource tree root, or failure if tree construction fails
