# Future — fgv

Parking-lot ideas that aren't current work, aren't non-goals, but
need concrete demand or design before they can be scheduled. Items

## `integrations/` top-level directory for Result-integration boundary packages

The `crypto-batch-2-webauthn` stream shipped two packages (`@fgv/ts-extras-webauthn`, `@fgv/ts-web-extras-webauthn`) whose entire mission is to wrap a well-maintained upstream library (`@simplewebauthn/*`) and adapt its throw-based API into the fgv `Result<T>` model. The package boundary is the whole product; no fgv-specific abstraction sits on top. This is structurally distinct from the libraries under `libraries/` that publish original utility primitives.

The question: does the pattern deserve its own top-level directory (e.g. `integrations/`), or is `libraries/` plus the naming convention `ts-extras-X` / `ts-web-extras-X` sufficient signal? Today the packages live in `libraries/` for consistency, but as the pattern recurs (likely candidates: future LLM provider wrappers, future credential-protocol wrappers) the structural distinction may earn its own home.

**Why deferred**: only one batch of packages so far (`-webauthn`); not enough recurrence to justify a directory rename. Decide when the second or third such package lands and the pattern is clearly distinct from "library that publishes original utilities."

**Dependencies**: at least one more Result-integration-boundary package landing; or a concrete consumer-side ergonomics complaint about discoverability of these packages.
